FC_CPP
------

This project includes demonstrations of the project author's carrying out
programming assignments in the Udemy course "C++ Fundamentals: Game
Programming for Beginners" <https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/>,
referred to as FC_CPP on Gamedev.tv.  This is not a substitute for the course.
The repository of instructor solutions is not open-source and all rights are
reserved, although students are instructed in achieving their equivalents.
<https://gitlab.com/GameDevTV/CPPCourse>.

There are necessary similarities in the use of software and tools in achieving
the assignment results; the work to do so here is by this project's author and
similarities to course-offered results are unavoidable.  Nevertheless, the
tools are used here in quite different ways than provided by the FC_CPP
instructors.  The notices incorporated in the various solutions here shall not
be removed and suitable acknowledgment must be provided in any derivative
usage.
