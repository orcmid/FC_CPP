# FC\_CPP Fundamentals of CPP for Game Developers - Assignments

The `orcmid/FC_CPP` project works through programming assignments of the
[Udemy FC_CPP](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/) course. The
assignments are carried out using freely-available tools for building and
running programs on Microsoft Windows.

The [Notice](NOTICE.txt) accounts for the connection to the class.  The
assignments are carried out here as applications of
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools).  The programs are compiled
using Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools and developer command prompts on
Windows.  The objective is to have an on-ramp and guard rails for novices that
want to develop native applications for Microsoft Windows on desktop PCs and
laptops.

The repository and its construction, along with development steps, are
organized in the individual repository folders.  The organization is sketched
at [FC_CPP.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/FC_CPP/blob/main/FC_CPP.txt).

The narration of the assignment steps and examples for confirmation of the
solutions by other students are here.

## The Very First Step

\[TBD on a separate page\]
<!--
I recommend creation of a folder for all of the programming that is done as
part of the FC_CPP class.  A convenient place on Windows is the Documents
folder.  I am assuming that here.

. Go to the File Explorer and choose Documents in the Quick Access list.
. Use the New Folder operation to make a folder for the FC_CPP programming.
 I used `FC_CPP` for the name of my overall folder, putting it on my computer
 at `D:\Documents\GitHub\` for grouping with other projects.  Put yours where
 it will be easy for you to find and work in.
. Inside ***that*** folder, make one for the first program.  That's interior
folder `S1-FirstProgram` in my example.  It may be convenient to use the same
name in following along and comparing your results.

## The Next Steps \[also TBD\]
