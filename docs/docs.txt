                    Orcmid's Windows Companion to FC_CPP
                    ====================================

        <https://github.com/orcmid/FC_CPP/blob/main/docs/docs.txt>
                  <https://orcmid.github.io/FC_CPP/docs.txt>

              WEB DOCUMENTATION OF THE WINDOWS COMPANION TO FC_CPP
              ----------------------------------------------------

    Documentation of FC_CPP is provided so it can be viewed and understood
    via <https://orcmid.github.io/FC_CPP/>.  This keeps images and narration
    from cluttering the code files.  We take advantage of the GitHub feature
    for publishing from docs/.

    This file, doc.txt, is the entry to the FC_CPP site-authoring construction
    structure.  That structure is extended thrughout the web site. The pattern
    for site construction is a case of Document Engineering Project (docEng),
    at <https://github.com/orcmid/docEng> (https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/).

    nfoTools are relied upon for much of the explanatory background and HOWTOs
    with regard to use of Visual Studio Build Tools, especially cl.exe and the
    developer command prompt.  We do not attempt to repeat any of that here,
    only illustrate it and link to more detail at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/>.

TODO

  * Provide detailed connection to the docEng pattern documentation whenever.

  * Prepare for folio structure working through the exercises.

  * Add an explanation to NOTICE.txt sort of like the Creative Commons simple
   deed.

  * Arrange link to the (this) construction structure.

  * Attribution on the published pages too?

  * Deal with prerequisites.  See the statement at rayLab on the subject.
    Here, we want to provide more and also find something gentle enough
    for beginners.  This is what skills is intended to butress.  Need to
    get going on those and on the toolcraft too.

  * There will be topics on construction and scaffolding that belong
    under construction/ and any About material, just like any orcmid GitHub
    proect.

  * Mention/Emphasize Visual Studio Code on the web and cover in the
    getting started.

  * Setup S0-GettingStarted, S1-FirstProgram, and S2-Axe as initial folders
    here.  Maybe simplify the URLs though.
