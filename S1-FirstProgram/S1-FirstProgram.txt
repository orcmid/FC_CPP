              C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners
              ================================================

            BUILDING THE FC_CPP FIRST PROGRAM WITH VC NATIVE TOOLS
            ------------------------------------------------------

    This is a  Native VC/C++ solution to the first programming assignmens in
    the Udemy course, "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners,"
    <https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/>.

    There is minimal use of freely-available tools as part of a first exposure
    and demonstration of simple cases.  Subsequent assigments will expand use
    of additional powers.

BASIC ASSUMPTIONS

    1. The assignments and programming solutions are in English
    2. Operation is by keyboard and mouse with a desktop PC or laptop and 14"
       or larger display.
    3. The PC is running a recent version of Microsoft Windows (version 10 or
       11 preferred).
    4. There is familiarity with the Windows File Explorer and its use for
       creating and navigating among file folders (directories)

PREREQUISITES

    5. Have a text editor for making text and C/C++ program code files.
       Microsoft Visual Studio Code is used for illustration.  VS Code is
       recommended for features to be employed in progression to more-
       powerful operation.
    6. A recent version of Visual Studio has been installed.  The examples
       will require only the Visual Studio Build Tools.  Additional features
       of Visual Studio Community Editions and Professional Editions are not
       employed.
    7. Use of a VS Developer Command Prompt is required.  Basic use of the
       command-line environment is required in the approach employed here.

       [Links to tool installation and operation web pages to be supplied.]

INITIAL SETUP

    [TBD]

EDIT, COMPILE, ANALYZE ERROR REPORTS, TEST/RUN, RINSE, REPEAT

    [TBD]

MANIFEST

    S1-FirstProgram.txt
        this synopsis, narration, manifest, and job jar

    hello.c
        A version of the first program, as C since no CPP features are
        required

    hello.obj
        a byproduct of successfully compiling hello.c using the VC/C++
        program cl.exe

    hello.exe
        the final result of successfully compiling hello.c using the VC/C++
        program cl.exe

    Hello-2021-10-2152-CommandPromptBuild.png
        example of establishing the developer command-line environment,
        navigating to this folder, compiling the program, running the
        resulting program, and dispaying the directory content as it was
        at that time.

    .gitignore
        is a file that applies to the use of Git and GitHub in providing
        backup of the materials in this folder.  Not essential for the
        assignment; Git and GitHub are introduced as a valuable practices
        later.

TODO

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

  * Complete the .gitattributes and .gitignore for here

  * Link to VS Build Tools installation

  * Link to Developer Command Prompt

  * Link to creation of shortcuts

  * Have background and links for the S1 and S2 folios, prrerquisities,
    and the tools involved
    ** Command Prompt
    ** VS Code
    ** VC command line environment
    ** the Command Prompt edit, save, compile, run/test, rinse repeat.
    ** other skill identifications, appealing to nfoTools materials and
       linked resources
