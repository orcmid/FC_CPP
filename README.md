# Orcmid's Windows Companion to FC_CPP: Fundamentals of C++ for Game Developers

This is a repository for a companion to the programming assignments of the
[Udemy FC_CPP](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/) course.  The
companion features freely-available tools for building and running programs
on Microsoft Windows.  The [Notice](NOTICE.txt) accounts for the connection to the Udemy course.

The companion materials are published in web pages of
[orcmid.github.io/FC_CPP](https://orcmid.github.io/FC_CPP).

The repository and its construction, along with development steps, are
narrated in the individual folders.  That implementation organization is
sketched at [FC_CPP.txt](FC_CPP.txt)

## The Very First Step

I recommend creation of a folder for all of the programming that is done as
part of the FC_CPP class.  A convenient place on Windows is the Documents
folder.  I am assuming that here.

. Go to the File Explorer and choose Documents in the Quick Access list.
. Use the New Folder operation to make a folder for the FC_CPP programming.
 I used `FC_CPP` for the name of my overall folder, putting it on my computer
 at `D:\Documents\GitHub\` for grouping with other projects.  Put yours where
 it will be easy for you to find and work in.
. Inside ***that*** folder, make one for the first program.  That's interior
folder `S1-FirstProgram` in my example.  It may be convenient to use the same
name in following along and comparing your results.

## The Next Steps

| **Subfolder** |  **Topic** |
|   --:       |  ---               |
| [S0-GettingStarted](S0-GettingStarted/S0-GettingStarted.txt) | Preliminaries and "Hello World" |
| [S1-FirstProgram](S1-FirstProgram/S1-FirstProgram.txt) | The `hello.c` First Program |
| [S2-Axe](S2-Axe/S2-Axe.txt) | Building up the Axe Game |
