# FC\_CPP Fundamentals of CPP for Game Developers - Assignments

This is a repository for working through programming assignments of the
[Udemy FC_CPP](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/) course with
freely-available tools for building and running programs on Microsoft
Windows.  The [Notice](NOTICE.txt) accounts for the connection to the class.

There is no separate documentation at this point.  The repository and its
construction, along with development steps, are sketched in the individual
folders.  The organization is sketched at [FC_CPP.txt](FC_CPP.txt)

## The Very First Step

I recommend creation of a folder for all of the programming that is done as
part of the FC_CPP class.  A convenient place on Windows is the Documents
folder.  I am assuming that here.

. Go to the File Explorer and choose Documents in the Quick Access list.
. Use the New Folder operation to make a folder for the FC_CPP programming.
 I used `FC_CPP` for the name of my overall folder, putting it on my computer
 at `D:\Documents\GitHub\` for grouping with other projects.  Put yours where
 it will be easy for you to find and work in.
. Inside ***that*** folder, make one for the first program.  That's interior
folder `S1-FirstProgram` in my example.  It may be convenient to use the same
name in following along and comparing your results.

## The Next Steps

| **Subfolder** |  **Topic** |
|   --:       |  ---               |
| [S1-FirstProgram](S1-FirstProgram/S1-FirstProgram.txt) | The `hello.c` First Program |
| [S2-Axe](S2-Axe/S2-Axe.txt) | Building up the Axe Game |
