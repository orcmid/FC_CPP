# FC\_CPP Fundamentals of CPP for Game Developers - Assignments

This is a private repository for working through the programming assignments
of the Udemy FC_CPP course employing only freely-available tools for making
software programs that run on Microsoft Windows.

There is no separate documentation at this point.  The repository and its
construction, along with development steps, are sketched in the individual
folders.  The organization is sketched at [FC_CPP.txt](FC_CPP.txt)

## The Very First Step

It helps to anticipate a little and create a workspace on your computer.

I recommend creation of a folder for all of the programming that is done as
part of the FC_CPP class.  A convenient place on Windows is the Documents
folder.  I am assuming that here.

. Go to the File Explorer and choose Documents in the Quick access list.
. Use the New Folder operation to make a folder for the FC_CPP programming.
 I used `FC_CPP` for the name of my overall folder.
. Inside ***that*** folder, make one for the first program.  That's interior
folder `S1-FirstProgram` in my case.  It may be more convenient to use these
same names although there is no technical requirement to do so.

## The Next Steps

| **Subfolder** |  **Topic** |
|   --:       |  ---               |
| [S1-FirstProgram](S1-FirstProgram/S1-FirstProgram.txt) | The `hello.c` First Program |
| [S2-Axe](S2-Axe/S2-Axe.txt) | Building up the Axe Game |
