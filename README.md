# FC_CPP Fundamentals of CPP for Game Developers - Assignments

This is a private repository for working through the programming assignments
of the Udemy FC_CPP course employing only freely-available tools for making
software programs that run on Microsoft Windows.

There is no separate documentation at this point.  The repository and its
construction, along with development steps, are sketched in the individual
folders.  The organization is sketched at [FC_CPP.txt](FC_CPP.txt)
