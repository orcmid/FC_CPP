              C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners
              ================================================

                     <https://github.com/orcmid/FC_CPP>

                       ORCMID'S PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS
                       --------------------------------

    These are Native VC/C++ solutions to the programming assignments in
    the Udemy course, "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners,"
    <https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/>.

    I started when the course was announced and I was dismayed by the lack
    of on-ramp and guard rails for beginners.  I also felt that unification
    around MingW as part of raylib install was suboptimal for studentw who
    might benefit more with a simpler use of Microsoft VS Build Tools and
    the native compiler, cl.exe.  I am focused on the Windows case.

    This private repository is where I work out those solutions and support
    public nfoTools provisions for understanding the tools and simple ways
    of operating with them.  The raylib project provides support for this
    avenue.

MANIFEST

    FC_CPP.txt
        this synopsis, manifest, and job jar
    README.md
        typical for GitHub projects, a simple placeholder in this case

    S1-FirstProgram/
        A version of the first program, as C since no CPP features are
        required

    S2-Axe/
        The second program, the first to employ raylib

    raylib/
        The installed raylib-3.7.0 files accessed as a library of code
        for its graphical functions.  It is not including in Git. Each user
        of a clone will need to unpack their own.
    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        The zip from which raylib-3.7.0/ was extracted and renamed so it is
        easy to slip in a later version.

    LICENSE.txt
        the Apache License is not so relevant here, but I want to demonstrate
        the practice

    .gitatttibutes
        used to differentiate text and binary file formats for reliable
        sharing across platforms via Git
    .gitignore
        used to eliminate locally-specific materials from the Git, keeping
        clones from polluting the main shared GitHub repository

TODO

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

  * Complete the .gitattributes and .gitignore for here

  * Setup S1 and S2 programming assignments and their organization.

  * For S2, use a rawVC variant and refine its usage.

  * Link to VS Build Tools installation

  * Link to Developer Command Prompt

  * Link to creation of shortcuts

  * Have background and links for the S1 and S2 folios, prrerquisities,
    and the tools involved
