              C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners
              ================================================

                     <https://github.com/orcmid/FC_CPP>

                       ORCMID'S PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS
                       --------------------------------

    These are Native VC/C++ solutions to the programming assignments in
    the Udemy course, "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners,"
    <https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/>.

    I started when the course was announced and I was dismayed by the lack
    of on-ramp and guard rails for beginners.  I also felt that unification
    around MingW as part of raylib install was suboptimal for students who
    might benefit more with a simpler use of Microsoft VS Build Tools and
    the native compiler, cl.exe.  I don't see CMake and Visual Code workspaces
    as appropriate starting points.  There is too much mystery without any
    foundation.

    I am committed to Windows and VS Build Tools cases.  I might consider
    alternative use of raylib on and for other platforms as opportunities
    become evident.  The priority is for Windows and the enormous population
    of potentially-curious learners.

    This private repository is where I work out those solutions and support
    public nfoTools provisions for understanding the tools and simple ways
    of operating with them.  There are supporting provisions in the raylib
    project that allows for a simpler and ideally more-informative on-ramp.
    I will introduce one of those.

MANIFEST

    FC_CPP.txt
        this synopsis, manifest, and job jar
    README.md
        typical for GitHub projects, a simple placeholder in this case

    docs/
        folder for the authoring pages of the web narration of native Windows
        approaches to the Udemy FC_CPP assignments

    S1-FirstProgram/
        A version of the first program, as C since no CPP features are
        required

    S2-Axe/
        The second program, the first to employ raylib, still all in standard
        C 2011 (std:c11) for consistency with raylib itself

    raylib/
        The installed raylib-3.7.0 files accessed as a library of code
        for its graphical functions.  It is not including in Git. Each user
        of a clone will need to unpack their own.
    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        The zip from which raylib-3.7.0/ was extracted and renamed so it is
        easy to slip in a later version.

    LICENSE.txt
        the Apache License was originally not thought to be so relevant here.
        I want to demonstrate the practice from the beginning.
    NOTICE.txt
        Similarly, I am introducing an Apache-style NOTICE that I also use
        for "third-party" notifications and acknowledgments.

    .gitatttibutes
        used to differentiate text and binary file formats for reliable
        sharing across platforms via Git
    .gitignore
        used to eliminate locally-specific materials from the Git, keeping
        clones from polluting the main shared GitHub repository

TODO

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

   * Setup S1 and S2 programming assignments and their organization.

  * For S2, use a rawVC variant and refine its usage.

  * Link to VS Build Tools installation

  * Link to Developer Command Prompt

  * Link to creation of shortcuts

  * Have background and links for the S1 and S2 folios, prrerquisities,
    and the tools involved
    ** Command Prompt
    ** VS Code
    ** VC command line environment
    ** the Command Prompt edit, save, compile, run/test, rinse repeat.
    ** other skill identifications, appealing to nfoTools materials and
       linked resources

  * There is no reason that this couldn't be extended to MingW and also
    to *nix including WSL.  We can look at that for opportunistic options.
    I am less certain about Apple and MacOS.

  * This project is public so I can publish docs/.  I will continue
    cleaning up to be appropriate with respect to the Udemy course and
    Gamedev.tv.
