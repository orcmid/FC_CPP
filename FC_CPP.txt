              C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners
              ================================================

                     <https://github.com/orcmid/FC_CPP>
           <https://github.com/orcmid/FC_CPP/blob/main/FC_CPP.txt>

                       ORCMID'S PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS
                       --------------------------------

    These are Native VC/C++ solutions to the programming assignments in
    the Udemy course, "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners,"
    <https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/>.

    I am providing streamlined Windows and VS Build Tools cases.  The
    priority will always be Windows first and serving the enormous population
    of potentially-curious learners having Windows desktop PCs and laptops.

    The approach is minimalist: using the simplest direct methods that are
    sufficient for the assignments.  The idea is to have a clear on-ramp and
    guard rails for introduction of novices to this kind of programming.

    This public repository is where I work out my versions of the assignments.
    There is supporting information in the nfoTools project.  Links are made
    to nfoTools for introductions to essential tools and simple ways
    of operating with them <https://github.org/orcmid/nfoTools>.

    There are supporting provisions in the raylib project that provide a
    simpler and ideally more-informative on-ramp as well.  I will take
    advantage of those at <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib>.  I might
    consider alternative use of raylib for other platforms as opportunities
    become evident.

MANIFEST

    FC_CPP.txt
        this synopsis, manifest, and job jar
    README.md
        typical for GitHub projects, a simple placeholder in this case

    docs/
        folder for the authoring pages of the web narration of native Windows
        approaches to the Udemy FC_CPP assignments

    S1-FirstProgram/
        A version of the first program, as C since no CPP features are
        required

    S2-Axe/
        The second program, the first to employ raylib, still all in standard
        C 2011 (std:c11) for consistency with raylib itself

    raylib/
        The installed raylib-3.7.0 files accessed as a library of code
        for graphical functions.
    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        The zip from which raylib-3.7.0/ was extracted and renamed as simply
        raylib/ so it is easy to slip in a later version someday.

    LICENSE.txt
        I want to demonstrate the practice of having a specific open-source
        license from the beginning.
    NOTICE.txt
        Similarly, I am introducing an Apache-style NOTICE that I also use
        for "third-party" notifications and acknowledgments.

    .gitatttibutes
        used to differentiate text and binary file formats for reliable
        sharing across platforms via Git. These are for reliable backup of
        orcmid/FC_FCC using Git and GitHub.  It is not important for doing
        the assignments.  The value of Git arrangements will be described
        later on.
    .gitignore
        used to eliminate locally-specific materials from the Git, keeping
        clones from polluting the main shared GitHub repository

TODO

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

   * Setup S1 and S2 programming assignments and their organization.

  * For S2, use a rawVC variant and refine its usage.

  * Link to VS Build Tools installation

  * Link to Developer Command Prompt

  * Link to creation of shortcuts

  * Have background and links for the S1 and S2 folios, prrerquisities,
    and the tools involved
    ** Command Prompt
    ** VS Code
    ** VC command line environment
    ** the Command Prompt edit, save, compile, run/test, rinse repeat.
    ** other skill identifications, appealing to nfoTools materials and
       linked resources

  * There is no reason that this couldn't be extended to MingW and also
    to *nix including WSL.  We can look at that for opportunistic options.
    I am less certain about Apple and MacOS.

  * This project is public so I can publish docs/.  I will continue
    cleaning up to be appropriate with respect to the Udemy course and
    Gamedev.tv.
