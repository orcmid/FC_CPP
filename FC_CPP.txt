              C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners
              ================================================

                     ORCMID'S WINDOWS COMPANION TO FC_CPP
                     ------------------------------------

    The orcmid/FC_CPP project consists of companion materials to the Udemy
    course, "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners,"
    <https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/>.  Here is a leisurely
    introduction that employs only freely-available tools for native operation
    on Microsoft Windows.  Variations of the Udemy assignments illustrate
    C/C++ programming in clean styles.

    The narration of the companion is at <https://orcmid.github.io/FC_CPP>.

    There are streamlined Windows and VS Build Tools cases.  The priority
    is Windows first, serving the enormous population of potentially-curious
    learners having Windows desktop PCs and laptops.

    The approach is minimalist: using the simplest direct methods that are
    sufficient for the assignments.  The idea is to have a clear on-ramp and
    guard rails for introduction of novices to this kind of programming.  The
    clean use of C/C++ language standards is adhered to.

    This public repository is where I work out my versions of the assignments
    and supplementary materials.  There is supporting information in the
    nfoTools project for detailed introductions to essential tools and simple
    operations with them <https://orcmid.github.io/orcmid/nfoTools>.

    There are supporting provisions in the raylib project that provide a
    simpler and ideally more-informative on-ramp as well.  I will take
    advantage of those at <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib>.

MANIFEST

    FC_CPP.txt
        this synopsis, manifest, and job jar
    README.md
        typical for GitHub projects, a simple placeholder in this case

    docs/
        folder for the authoring pages of the web narration of native Windows
        approaches to the Udemy FC_CPP assignments

    S0-GettingStarted/
        A separate section on setting up and confirming setups with cl.exe
        and the most-famous Hello World program ever.

    S1-FirstProgram/
        A version of the first program, as C since no CPP features are
        required.  Preserving that distinction is emphasized.

    S2-Axe/
        The second program, the first to employ raylib, still all in standard
        C 2011 (std:c11) for consistency with raylib itself

    raylib/
        The installed raylib-3.7.0 files accessed as a library of code
        for graphical functions.
    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        The zip from which raylib-3.7.0/ was extracted and renamed as simply
        raylib/ so it is easy to slip in a later version someday.

    LICENSE.txt
        I want to demonstrate the practice of having a specific open-source
        license from the beginning.
    NOTICE.txt
        Similarly, I am introducing an Apache-style NOTICE that I also use
        for "third-party" notifications and acknowledgments.

    .gitatttibutes
        used to differentiate text and binary file formats for reliable
        sharing across platforms via Git. These are for reliable backup of
        orcmid/FC_FCC using Git and GitHub.  It is not important for doing
        the assignments.  The value of Git arrangements will be described
        later on.
    .gitignore
        used to eliminate locally-specific materials from the Git, keeping
        clones from polluting the main shared GitHub repository

TODO

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

   * Setup S1 and S2 programming assignments and their organization.

  * For S2, use a rawVC variant and refine its usage.

  * Link to VS Build Tools installation

  * Link to Developer Command Prompt

  * Link to creation of shortcuts

  * Have background and links for the S1 and S2 folios, prrerquisities,
    and the tools involved
    ** Command Prompt
    ** VS Code
    ** VC command line environment
    ** the Command Prompt edit, save, compile, run/test, rinse repeat.
    ** other skill identifications, appealing to nfoTools materials and
       linked resources

  * There is no reason that this couldn't be extended to MingW and also
    to *nix including WSL.  We can look at that for opportunistic options.
    I am less certain about Apple and MacOS.

  * Continue cleaning up to be appropriate with respect to the Udemy course
    and Gamedev.tv.

  * Use the raylib practice of // Reuired for: or what it is on #includes.
    I had been forgetting to do that even though I practice it elsewhere :).

  * I need to get the sequence of tool installations set up properly and
    nfoTools should reflect that also.  Break it down.  I think I have a
    reason in Obsidian.
