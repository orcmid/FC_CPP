TODO

  * Make notes on this section of the class.

  * Continue refining rayApp.bat until it is eligible to be supplied as a
    template Zip from nfoTools.

  * Link to VS Build Tools installation

  * Link to Developer Command Prompt

  * Link to creation of shortcuts

  * Have background and links for the S1 and S2 folios, prrerquisities,
    and the tools involved

  * Explain the edit, build, review, run/test cyle and how we can itterate
    with the command prompt and an editor such as Visual Studio Code.

  * Explain dependence on the raylib 3.7.0 release and needing to reconfirm
    everything if a release with breaking changes (4.0.0 for one) introduced.

  * Provide a better link to more detail in rayConfirm.c.  Keep in mind that
    the setup is prototyping a generic one for native Windows raylib builds.

  * Figure out an appropriate way to unpack and use VCrayApp.zip in setting
    up a raylib-based application.

  * Get straight about the .gitignores.  Maybe there but editable?  These
    are all not part of any clone where VCrayApp.zip is unpacked.  I guess
    I would include them but then they need to be editable here.  Figure out
    how to handle this for novices.

  * Adjust rayApp.bat to confirm the location of raylib since it is not
    moveable.
