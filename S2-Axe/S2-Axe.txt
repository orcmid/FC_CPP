TODO

  * Make notes on this section of the class.

  * For S2, use a rawVC variant and prototype its usage.  Then switch to
    introducing this from a rayLab template zip.

  * Link to VS Build Tools installation

  * Link to Developer Command Prompt

  * Link to creation of shortcuts

  * Have background and links for the S1 and S2 folios, prrerquisities,
    and the tools involved

  * Explain the edit, build, review, run/test cyle and how we can itterate
    with the command prompt and an editor such as Visual Studio Code.

  * Explain dependence on the raylib 3.7.0 release and needing to reconfirm
    everything if a release with breaking changes (4.0.0 for one) introduced.

  * Provide a better link to more detail in rayConfirm.c.  Keep in mind that
    the setup is prototyping a generic one for native Windows raylib builds.

  * Figure out an appropriate way to unpack and use VCrayApp.zip in setting
    up a raylib-based application.
