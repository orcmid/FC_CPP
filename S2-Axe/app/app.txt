            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                          S2-AXE XCOPY APP FOLDER
                          -----------------------

    The app/ folder is a standard subfolder for a command-line build in the
    parent (e.g., S2-Axe) folder.  app/ receives the compiled .exe and any
    accompanying files/folders that are required for usage of the executable
    program.

    The folder is amenable to XCopy deployment, or potential use in creating
    an MSIX distributable.  The app/ folder should be amenable to Zipping up,
    possibly after removing some scaffolding.  Addition of a README and other
    user-supporting materials would be handy.

    In zipping up the content of this folder, either selectively zip the
    .exe and any resources/ or zip everything and then remove the files
    that are not part of the deliverable.

TODO

  * Confirm that executable can be created when compilation is in a sister
    folder.  Something like /Fe..\app\app.exe

  * Determine what the context of options and command line parameters is
    (more under wrk.txt and also toolcraft)

  * Add a NOTICE.txt that acknowledges development and construction.
