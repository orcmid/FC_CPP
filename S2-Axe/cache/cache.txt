            PROTOTYPING OF RAYLIB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                         S2-AXE RAYLIB CACHE FOLDER
                         --------------------------

    The cache/ will contain intermediate results of compile activities.  These
    are not required after the build and can easily be reconstructed in a
    subsequent build.  They are kept around because they usually do not change
    when the application code is changed and compiled over and over.

    There are additional files manifested here that are part of the setup
    bundle and should be retained for confirmation of build setup success,
    especially when using different sources indicates troubles.

    When this folder is extracted from a setup Zip file, the language will
    be adjusted accordingly.

MANIFEST

    cache.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file
    .gitignore
        excluding the compilation intermediates and supporting files from
        any git commits

    rayConfirm.c
        part of the raylib setup, used to confirm and demonstrate building
        of a raylib application using VS Build Tools and VS Code.  Once
        confirmed, rayAppBuild.bat can be adjusted to compile the user's
        raylib project files instead.

    VCoptions.opt
        C Language compilation options for Visual C/C++ native compiler cl.exe
        These options must be consistent between cache and app compiles

    raylibCode.opt
        Option file identifying the raylib modules to be cached

    raylibVars.opt
        Preprocessor definitions for the compilation of raylib modules.

    *.obj
        Microsoft compiled C Language *.obj modules from compilation of the
        raylib files identified in raylibCode.opt.  If rglfw.obj is not
        present, the cache is considered to be incomplete or empty and it
        will be rebuilt

TODO

  * Replace this when a Zip-extracted setup provides this folder and the
    additional configuration files.

  * When packaged and extracted via a VCrayApp,zip, rename as an nfoTools
    product and make the result more-seriously under .gitignore
